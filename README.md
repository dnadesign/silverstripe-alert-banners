# SilverStripe Alert Banners

Allows management of alert banners that can be dismissed by users.

JavaScript functionality is included which will hide the banner and set a cookie so that the user will not see the banner again for a CMS defined (in days) period of time.

No styles are included so you will need to create your own.
