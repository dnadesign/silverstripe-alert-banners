# SilverStripe Alert Banners

Allows management of alert banners that can be dismissed by users.

JavaScript functionality is included which will hide the banner and set an item on session storage so that the user will not see the banner again for as long as the users browser session lasts.

No styles are included so you will need to create your own.
